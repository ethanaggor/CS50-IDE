For 6 functions of runoff.c:

bool vote
    look for a candidate called name
        if candidate is found
            update preferences so that they are the voter's rank preference
        else
            do not update preferences and return false

void tabulate !!! If things aren't working, come back to this function
    look for top-preferred candidate
    if candidate is not eliminated
        update candidate vote++
        return
    else
    continue for loop until candidate who is not eliminated is found
