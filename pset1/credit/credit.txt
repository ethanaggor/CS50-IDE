Take input and calculate checksum
    Multiply every other digit by 2, starting with the number’s second-to-last digit, and then add those products’ digits together.
    Add the sum to the sum of the digits that weren’t multiplied by 2.
    If the total’s last digit is 0 (or, put more formally, if the total modulo 10 is congruent to 0), the number is valid and go to line 7
    Else, print INVALID
